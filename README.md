# Book Management System  
## Description 
A file includes records of already published Book objects (you should be familiar with). The file includes
syntatically correct records, each with 6 fields. There is nothing semantically wrong with the records, except
for one issue in relation to the publication year, where some years were incorrectly recorded as 2024 or more.
Please notice also that the title does not include a “,” as part of it. The ISBN numbers are also assumed to be
valid long integers.
